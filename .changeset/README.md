# Changesets

We use Changesets to manage versions and releases across workspaces.

Common commands:
- npm run changeset       # create a new changeset (select packages, bump types, notes)
- npm run version-packages # apply version bumps and update changelogs
- npm run release          # publish to npm (after tagging / CI)

See https://github.com/changesets/changesets for full docs.
